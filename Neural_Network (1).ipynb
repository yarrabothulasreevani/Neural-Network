            "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**, which involves how sunlight interacts with Earth's atmosphere. Here's a breakdown:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Sunlight is White Light:** What we perceive as \"white\" sunlight is actually composed of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) – each with a different wavelength.\n",
            "    *   **Shorter Wavelengths:** Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths.\n",
            "    *   **Longer Wavelengths:** Red and orange light have longer wavelengths.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Earth's Atmosphere:** Our atmosphere is made up of various gases, primarily nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), along with tiny particles. These gas molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Rayleigh Scattering:** When sunlight enters the atmosphere:\n",
            "    *   **Preference for Short Wavelengths:** The tiny nitrogen and oxygen molecules are most effective at scattering shorter wavelength light (blue and violet) in all directions. They scatter blue light about 10 times more effectively than red light.\n",
            "    *   **Long Wavelengths Pass Through:** Longer wavelength light (red, orange, yellow) is not scattered as much and tends to pass straight through the atmosphere to our eyes.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Why Blue (and not Violet)?**\n",
            "    *   While violet light is scattered even more than blue light, there are two main reasons why we see a blue sky instead of a violet one:\n",
            "        *   **Sun's Emission:** The Sun emits slightly less violet light than blue light in its visible spectrum.\n",
            "        *   **Human Eye Sensitivity:** Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than to violet light. The combination of these factors, along with some green and other colors, results in us perceiving the sky as blue.\n",
            "\n",
            "**In summary:** As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue and violet light is scattered in every direction by the tiny air molecules. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky, making it appear blue.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is also why sunrises and sunsets often look red or orange: when the sun is low on the horizon, its light has to travel through much more atmosphere. Most of the blue light has been scattered away, leaving the longer-wavelength red and orange light to reach our eyes directly.\n"
